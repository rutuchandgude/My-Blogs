        <p class="cntr">You will always need to create some custom dummy data to test whether your plugin is working as expected, and as developers ourselves we have had this problem quite a lot. Thankfully, there are easy ways to solve it.

            The usual way people tend to do this is either hire someone on Fiverr, to create all this dummy text or as a WordPress developer youâ€™ll need to perform the task of filling up an empty theme with dummy content yourself.</p>
